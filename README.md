# Stock-Prediction-based-on-News-Articles

Overall Goal
The goal of this project is to predict the movement of stocks based on NLP based features extracted 
from financial news articles. 
Steps
- 
Collect financial ticker data and relevant news articles in a time frame
- 
Extract sentiment and key features (potentially use NER, topic modeling etc.) from news 
articles
- 
Train machine learning models to predict short-term stock movements
- 
Use appropriate evaluation metrics to evaluate the models
- 
Provide visualization and build UI


Data Sources & Approaches
News Articles: Scraped from financial news sites, APIs from Yahoo Finance, Google News etc.
Stock Price Data: Sourced from Yahoo Finance
Processing Tools: NLTK, SpaCy, Hugging Face Transformers, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly 
for visualization
Potential Machine Learning Models: Regression models, Random Forest, LSTMs, Transformer-
based models (BERT, FinBERT)
